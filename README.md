# Instructions for installing the livery
The livery can be hard to install sometimes and can be confusing so please follow these instructions carefully.

### Downloading the files
At the top of the repository there is a **green** button that says "**code**".

Please click this button and select **Download ZIP**.

After this the files will begin to download.

## After the files download follow the next steps
### Unzipping the files

On Windows you will want to right click on the folder and select "extract all" and select next.

After unzipping the folder you will see a folder named "JAS-39C-Gripen-Ukrainian-Livery-main". 

Inside this folder you will find another folder which you can click on until you see two folders named, "30_JAS-39C-UKR-07" and "textureFiles".

### Installing the texture files

The texture files will be installed into the mod's Fictional Livery folder.

To do this follow the file path to C:\Users\**Replace with your username**\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\Mods\aircraft\JAS39\Textures\JAS39_Fictional

**The "C" drive is where I have my version of DCS installed but yours might be different. Your DCS might not say ".openbeta" and that is perfectly fine, just go to where you have your DCS installed.**

It is simpler to have two explorer windows open. One having the "JAS39_Fictional" folder open and the other having the "textureFiles" folder open.

Once you have both of these folders open drag the .dds files out of the "textureFiles" folder into the "JAS39_Fictional" folder.

### Installing the 30_JAS-39C-UKR-07 folder

Follow the file path to C:\Users\**Replace with your username**\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\Mods\aircraft\JAS39\Liveries\JAS39Gripen

**The "C" drive is where I have my version of DCS installed but yours might be different. Your DCS might not say ".openbeta" and that is perfectly fine, just go to where you have your DCS installed.**

**If you don't have Flaming Cliffs 3 and only operate the AG version then you can put this folder into the "JAS39Gripen_AG" folder instead**

Drag the "30_JAS-39C-UKR-07" folder into the "JAS39Gripen folder" and the install is complete.
